# About
A simple yet customisable tool that runs in the Windows command-line interface. Built to help fine-tune tapping speed and stamina training for players of the popular rhythm game "osu!"

Made with the low-level programming language C to reduce latency as much as possible and provide the most accurate feedback.

Planning on making a new version with GUI in the future.
