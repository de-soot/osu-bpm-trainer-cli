# osu! BPM Trainer CLI
A simple yet customisable tool that runs in the command-line interface. Built to help fine-tune tapping speed and stamina training for players of the popular rhythm game `osu!`.

Made with `C` to reduce latency and provide accurate feedback to the user.

Future plans to make a new version with `GUI` in the future maybe using something like `GTK`.

## Usage
You can add your own music to tap along with by simply replacing the `music.wav` file in the program folder (default: empty).

### Note
- The name of the file must be `music.wav` exactly or else it will not work.
- The music file has to be in `.wav` format.
- To convert to `.wav`, use a file converter ( e.g.: To convert from `.mp3` to `.wav` use `https://cloudconvert.com/mp3-to-wav` ).
- You cannot simply change the file extension by renaming the file, it will not work.
