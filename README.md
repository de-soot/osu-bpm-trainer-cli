# About
A simple yet customisable tool that runs in the command-line interface. Built to help fine-tune tapping speed and stamina training for players of the popular rhythm game "osu!"

Made with C to reduce latency and provide accurate feedback to the user.

Planning on making a new version with GUI in the future.
